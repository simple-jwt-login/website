I'm very excited about this new website for Simple JWT Login, using [**Docusaurus 2**](https://docusaurus.io/).

Docusaurus offered me a simple way, to write documentation, and also build the website in the same place. The learning curve was fast, and I enjoyed writing code in React.

## Previous website
Previously, I've used [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) ( Also, a very cool site documentation generator) and the website has been made in PHP.

It was very hard to do changes, and add new pages because that involved a lot of coding, writing routes, and loading content.


## About the blog

While writing documentation, it came to my mind that it will also be cool to start a blog. In this blog I'm planning to write real world use-cases of the plugin and write announcements about the plugin.

So, if you are interested on what features have been implemented, or what tips&tricks you can use while you develop your website, keep an eye on this blog.


Also, I'm planning to publish the documentation to GitHub, so that, anybody can add/modify the things there. In fact, this documentation is made for you to understand.

I hope that, with the help of the community, there will be much easier for new users to use this plugin.
