Finally, the JavaScript SDK for Simple JWT Login has been released.

Here is a simple register example using the JS SDK:

```js
import { SimpleJwtLogin } from "simple-jwt-login";

const simpleJwtLogin = new SimpleJwtLogin(

  "AUTH_KEY"
);
let params = {
  email: "me@mydomain.com",
  password: "my-secret-password",
  nickname: "coolnickname",
};

let result = simpleJwtLogin.registerUser(params, "MY_AUTH_KEY");
```
