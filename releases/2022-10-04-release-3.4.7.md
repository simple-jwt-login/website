The version `3.4.7` has been released today on [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-jwt-login).

The changes include some security improvements and code re-factorization.

The plugin has been reviewed by the WordPress team, and after that, we did some changes to the plugin.

The following changes have been deployed with the new version:
- Remove code vulnerability from the JWT library. 
- Fix local file inclusion risk
- Variables sanitization
- Apply phpcs check on the whole plugin folder and not only on the src/ folder
- The plugin has been tested with WordPress 6.0.2
- Keep the current active tab when settings are saved
