The Simple JWT Login plugin allows you to secure specific API endpoints or all endpoints within your WordPress site. 
When an endpoint is protected, a valid JSON Web Token (JWT) must be included in the request to gain access. 

The following error will be displayed, when an endpoint is protected and no JWT is provided:

```json
{
"success": false,
  "data": {
    "message": "You are not authorized to access this endpoint.",
    "errorCode": 403,
    "type": "simple-jwt-login-route-protect"
  }
}
```

## Protection Modes

You can choose between two protection modes:
- **Protect all endpoints**
- **Protect only specific endpoints**

### 1. Protect All Endpoints
When enabled, this option secures all endpoints except those explicitly listed in the "Whitelist."
To exclude an endpoint from protection, add it to the whitelist using the "Add Endpoints +" button.

### 2. Protect Only Specific Endpoints
This option protects only the endpoints listed in the "Protect Endpoints" section.
To secure an endpoint, add it using the "Add Endpoint" button.

## Configuration Options

### Request Methods

For each endpoint, you can define which HTTP request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) require authentication.
Alternatively, selecting ALL will enforce the rule for every request method.

### Route Matching
There are two ways to define how an endpoint is matched:
- **Starts with**: The rule applies to any endpoint that begins with the specified path.
- **Exact match**: The rule applies only if the accessed endpoint exactly matches the specified path.
  
### Example Configurations

####  Example 1
Assume you specify `/wp/v2/users` with `ALL` and `Exact Match` in either the Protect or Whitelist settings.

The rule applies to these URLs:
- `http://yoursite.com/?rest_route=/wp/v2/users`
- `http://yoursite.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users`

#### Example 2
Assume you specify `/wp/v2/users` with `GET` and `Starts With` in either the Protect or Whitelist settings.

The rule applies to these URLs when called with `GET` only:
- `http://yoursite.com/?rest_route=/wp/v2/users`
- `http://yoursite.com/?rest_route=/wp/v2/users/1`
- `http://yoursite.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users`
- `http://yoursite.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1`
- `http://yoursite.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/{any_other_path}`

#### Example 3
Assume you specify `/wp/v2` with `ALL` and `Starts With` in either the `Apply only on Specific Endpoints`.

This way, you are making all the endpoints under `/wp/v2*` protected and they will be accessible only with a JWT.

For example, all these endpoints will be protected:
- `/wp/v2/users` 
- `/wp/v2/posts`
- `/wp/v2/comments`

## How to Pass the JWT

The JWT token can be provided in multiple ways, depending on the options set in the pluginâ€™s General settings:
- Header
- Request URI
- Request Body
- Session
- Cookie

### Examples

#### Sending JWT in header:
```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost/wp/v2/users" -H "Authorization: YOUR_JWT"
```

#### Sending JWT as query parameters:

```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost/wp/v2/users?jwt=YOUR_JWT"
```
or

```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost?rest_route=/wp/v2/users&jwt=YOUR_JWT"
```

#### Sending JWT as request body:
```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost/wp/v2/users" -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{"JWT":"JYOUR JWT"}'
```


By following these instructions, you can efficiently protect and manage API access using Simple JWT Login.
