## Create an application

To enable Google authentication in your application, follow these step-by-step instructions to create a new project and obtain the necessary credentials from the Google Developer Console.

1. Navigate to Google Developer Console [https://console.developers.google.com/apis/](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/)
2. Create a new project
3. Once the project has been created, go to "Credentials" and click on "+Create Credentials"
4. Select "OAuth client ID"
5. Choose Application Type "Web application"
6. Configure Authorized Redirect URIs: In the "Authorized redirect URIs" section, add the URL where the OAuth flow will redirect users after successful authentication. This URL is crucial for the OAuth process.
7. Copy `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `redirect_uri`

:::note
If you want to use OAuth on WordPress, you need to add int the `Authorized redirect URIs` the following URL:
```
http://{{your-wordpressdomain}}/?rest_route=/simple-jwt-login/v1/oauth/token&provider=google
```
:::

:::warning Important Notes
- Keep your credentials secure. Do not expose them in publicly accessible locations or version control systems.
- If your application has multiple environments (e.g., development, production), create separate OAuth client IDs and redirect URIs for each environment.
