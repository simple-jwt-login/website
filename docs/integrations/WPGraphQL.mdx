With Simple-JWT-Login, you can now securely authenticate API requests for [WPGraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/) endpoints using JWT.
This integration makes it easier to build headless WordPress applications that require secure, token-based authentication for GraphQL queries and mutations.

## Key Features:
- **JWT Authentication for WPGraphQL** – Securely access GraphQL endpoints with JWT tokens.
- **Seamless Integration** – Works natively with WPGraphQL, enabling authentication for protected queries and mutations.
- **Flexible Authentication** – Include a JWT in request headers to authenticate API requests effortlessly.

This feature is ideal for **headless WordPress setups**, allowing front-end applications to authenticate users and perform **secure GraphQL operations**.

## Setup Guide

### Enable WPGraphQL Authentication

Go to **Simple-JWT-Login Settings** and enable **WPGraphQL Authorization**.

### Test an Unauthenticated Request
Try calling a **WPGraphQL endpoint** without authentication—you should receive an **Unauthorized error**:

### Authenticate and Use JWT
Once you authenticate and obtain a valid JWT, include it in your request headers.

Now, your API calls will be **authenticated**:
