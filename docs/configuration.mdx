## Server

You can access the Simple-JWT-Login API in two modes:
  - **using permalink**:  `https://{domain}/wp-json/simple-jwt-login/v1/\{endpoint}`
  - **using rest_route**: `https://{domain}/?rest_route=/simple-jwt-login/v1/{endpoint}`

## Request Parameters

The request parameters can be sent as follows:
 - Form Data
 - Query parameters
 - Request body ( as JSON )
 

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
This API features Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) implemented in compliance with  [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/).
And that allows cross-domain communication from the browser.

All responses have a wildcard same-origin which makes them completely public and accessible to everyone, including any code on any site.

## Configuration

1. Go to “General section”
2. Set a “JWT Decryption key”. With this key, we will validate your JWT.
3. Choose “JWT Decryption algorithm”.
4. Save Changes

:::caution

For security reasons, please make sure you use a complex decryption key and also include special characters in your decryption key.

## Get JWT from option
By default, only the REQUEST is `on`.  This means that the plugin will search in the request for the JWT. 

Also, you set to search in: 
1. REQUEST ( plugin will search for the `JWT` key : `&JWT=your_jwt`)
2. SESSION ( plugin will search for the `simple-jwt-login-token` key:  `$_SESSION['simple-jwt-login-token']`)
3. COOKIE ( plugin will search for the `simple-jwt-login-token` key: `$_COOKIE['simple-jwt-login-token']`)
4. HEADER ( plugin will search in the `Authorization` header: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_HERE`)

If JWT is provided in multiple places, the higher number of the option will overwrite the smaller one.

For example, let's say you will send a JWT in REQUEST and in HEADER. The header JWT will be used. 

:::note

I recommend you to enable the HEADER option, and always send the JWT in the header.

## Allow JWT usage on all endpoints
 
In order to use this feature, you will need to check "All WordPress endpoints checks for JWT authentication" in the "General" section.
When a JWT is found, first, you will be authenticated as the user in the JWT, and then the call to the endpoint will be made.

For example, you can create posts, as a specific user, if you provide a JWT in your request.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://simplejwtlogin.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?content=PostContent&title=PostTitle" \
    -d '{"JWT":"YOUR_JWT_HERE"}'
```

or 

```bash
curl -X POST "https://simplejwtlogin.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_HERE" \
    --form title="Title" \
    --form content="My content" \
    --form type="page"
```

For the second example, you need to make sure that you allow search for JWT in the header( you can set this in: General settings -> Get JWT token from )

:::note

When you pass the `JWT` parameter, it is not case-sensitive. You can also pass it as `jwt`.
